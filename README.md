My girlfriend says some really odd stuff. For her birthday I thought it would be an awesome idea to make sure that we could store these gems on our local network. This was the application that was made.

## Installation

#Copy the repo to your webserver.
#Modify all php and sql directory files to use your mysql.
#Run ./sql/install.php to setup the DB.
#Open the root directory in any browser.
